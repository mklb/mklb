🔝 This is my cardboard display Wookiee next to my desk. Currently I am working on bringing better pricing strategies to the mobile apps market. May I introduce [Mage](http://www.getmage.io/)! *The Mage SDK will automate price setting for your in app purchases per country.* No datascience-, marketing or developer team needed! Nice, right?

I love mobile Apps. This is why I designed, developed and published some over the years, I guess 👇 .

- 🍩  created the cutest productivity app [Donut Dog](https://donutdog.club) which was featured multiple times in Apple App Stores arround the world! Get rewarded for not using your phone while being productive. In the meantime a donut maschine will bake some awesome looking donuts. You can feed these donuts to your dog "Focus", buy faster donut machines and new/better donut recipes!
- 🍿  created a spoiler free movie finder app called [Popflake](https://popflakeapp.com/) (still in the app stores but not actively maintained anymore). Ever wanted to finde a movie where students die in the forest? Simply click on *students*, *forsest*, *death*. No, I am not kidding 🤷‍♂️  101% spoiler free!
- 👁  created an early Jodel App competitor called [Hoomie](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hoomie/id1114573985) in 2016 but troped the idea pretty fast. Jodel was very quickly established, I had no marketing plan. Even though I thought Hoomie had the better features, I dropped the side project after the initial release.
